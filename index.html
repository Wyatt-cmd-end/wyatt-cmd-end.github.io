                <dd class="small2">I like this class because it helps me develop skills I can use in the real life. Although this class is very hard its good because everytime I make mistakes I am able to learn from them in an harsh class like this. Because of the amount of projects we get assigned this year I think this class will help me alot on time management so that in the real world I can become a better and understanding worker with a good mindset that when I get a good job I know what to do.</dd>
